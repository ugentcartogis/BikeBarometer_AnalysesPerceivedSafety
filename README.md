# BikeBarometer_AnalysesPerceivedSafety

## DataAnalyses_Obj
R scripts for derivation of the multilevel linear models of perceived cycling safety versus objectively measured environmental factors for routes, road segments and intersections.

## DataAnalyses_Subj
R scripts for derivation of the multilevel linear models of perceived cycling safety versus subjectively scored environmental factors for routes, road segments and intersections.

## DataCleaning
Python scripts to find which records should be cleaned, based on defined hard and soft errors, to indicate which records to delete or not, and to eliminate the records from the original datafile.

## DescriptiveStatistics
R script to get some descriptive statistics about the datasets of the routes, road segments and intersections

## LinkingObjFactors
FME models to link objectively measured environmental factors along the road network to the geometry of routes, road segments and intersections.
